- Welcome to my furniture app UI, made using Flutter, inspired by a design from Dribbble.
- This app features a home page that displays a collection view of our furniture products, as well as a collection product page with a unique "story-like" swipe feature to easily browse through the products in a collection.
- Additionally, the app includes a collection product detail page which provides in-depth information on each product, including its name, price, and description.
- To navigate the app, simply swipe through the products on the collection product page or tap on a product to view its details on the collection product detail page. The home page also allows you to easily browse through our different furniture collections.
